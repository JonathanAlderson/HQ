# HQ
Program to play the HQ Trivia phone app.

HQ Trivia was a very popular phone quiz app in 2018.

This program makes use of Google Tesseract.
Where it would read what is on the phone screen. 
Then using wikipedia and other websites, pool infomation
about the questions to approximate which ones it thought were correct.

This program was fun to write becuase it involved lots of interesting problem 
solving and edge cases. It was also fun to write with a strict time requirement.

I didn't use this bot in real games.
